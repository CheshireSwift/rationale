Credit where credit is due
================================================================================

A lot of the code to make up this library was lifted and adapted from other open
source projects, so I wanna take the time to give them credit.

- [janestreet/base](https://github.com/janestreet/base) for their Monad and Applicative implementations
- [avsm/ocaml-lens](https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-lens) for their lens implementation
